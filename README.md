Front-end for fps-gain-trainer

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Install `node >= 8.10` and have `npm >= 5.6`.
- Next you're going to need to install React JS, `cd` into the directory where you want the project to live then run the following commands.
```
npx create-react-app app_name
cd app_name
``` 
- then you need to install `react-router-dom`
```
npm i react-router-dom
```
#### Alternatively
- if you have node installed already you can enter the following in your selected directory
```
npm i react
npm i react-router-dom
```

### Running.
- Run the `npm start` command in the directory
- A React homepage should show up if installed correctly.

## Note
* React JS is unable to run without node installed
* if you do have node already installed, please follow the "alternatively" route
